I am the IBM Consulting CTO for Public Sector in UKI, overseeing the technical work across the range of IBM's public clients. I am an IBM Distinguished Engineer, IBM Executive IT Architect and Open Group Distinguished Architect. I have spent much of my career in Public Sector but have also worked in other industries, including recently Financial Services and Telco. 

I would describe myself as a technical generalist with broad skills across a wide-variety of cloud, infrastructure, integration and application technologies. I am still a hands-on technologist especially with OpenShift, Linux and Python.

Much of my background and experience can be classified as complex systems integration having worked as Chief Architect of multiple large-scale complex systems in both sales and delivery.
